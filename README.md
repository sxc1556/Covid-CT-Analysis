# Covid-CT-Analysis
The goal of this project is to develop a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for COVID-19 diagnosis using CT images of lungs. In a 2D CT image, the indicator of COVID-19 positive is the ground class opacity at both lobes. In deep learning, convolutional neural network is applied for image classification. A CNN consists of many hidden layers, and each layer learns particular features of the input data. As each input neutron is connect to the next hidden layer, different features are learned gradually, which enables the neural network to analyze the whole input 2D image.
